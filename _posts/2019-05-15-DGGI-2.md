title: DGGI - update

{% include mathjax.html %}

I got some nice feedback about the first results of my attempt to implement DDGI
that I posted last time, so here is a small update about my dabbling.

Getting the VSM-visibility right proved difficult and I'm still not totally confident
that it is correct throughout. Performance-wise the bottleneck is the blending
of the ray tracing result into the probe datastructure. Im playing currently playing around
with different way to precompute the required fetches for each probe texel and rearrange
these to maximize coherency. A substantial performance boost is achievable that way, but
it may not be sufficient if the whole thing is applied to multiple cascades.
